            This sketch represents meditation as discipline and order, designed for users who seek focus through structure. 
            The clock’s Roman numerals and symmetry express mindfulness as calm awareness within the rhythm of time.
          <ul>
            To me, this clock reflects the disciplined side of meditation, being aware of each moment without letting it control you. The Roman numerals give the design a timeless and stable personality, suggesting mindfulness through order and repetition. 
            My goal was to make time feel calm rather than mechanical, so I focused on symmetry, gentle color tones, and clear spatial rhythm. The design process involved refining hand proportions and spacing until the composition felt balanced and intuitive to read. 
            The result is a clock that feels grounded and meditative. It invites the viewer to observe time slowly, without urgency. In the end, I see this clock as a medium for self-discipline in mindfulness.

            This sketch visualizes meditation as harmony with nature’s rhythm. 
            It is intended for users who reflect on balance, showing the passage of time through the natural flow of sunlight and moonlight.
          <ul>
            To me, this clock captures meditation as harmony with nature’s flow through the use of a visual representation of the world’s breathing. The sun and moon move vertically through the sky, reflecting the natural transitions between light and dark, awareness and rest. 
            I wanted to express time as a cycle rather than a countdown, emphasizing continuity over measurement. The gradual color shifts from warm yellows to cool blues create a sense of immersion. One of the biggest challenges was mapping the 24-hour day into a smooth, looping visual that feels real but symbolic at the same time. 
            The path of motion solved that by making the movement fluid and intuitive. This clock connects mindfulness to the environment, showing that time is not something to chase but something that flows around us constantly. It embodies the idea that meditation is not escape, it is to be in sync with the world’s rhythm.

            This sketch serves as a meditation timer that encourages patience and presence. 
            As the candle melts, it helps users stay aware of each passing moment, visually connecting mindfulness with the gentle decay of time.
          <ul>
            To me, the candle timer is a meditation on calm and focus; a visualization of how each moment slowly burns away. Instead of hands or digits, the candle melts over time, its flame flickering as wax drips accumulate at the base. 
            This design expresses a slower, more intentional relationship with time; one rooted in patience and observation. The process involved careful balancing of visuals and timing; syncing the rate of melting with real seconds while keeping the scene visually peaceful. 
            The wax pool, subtle color changes, and smoke create a visual that feels meditative rather than mechanical. Conceptually, it represents mindfulness in action; time passing not as loss, but as a moment of reflection and focus. The candle is both a timer and a teacher; to remain present, aware, and still as time ticks.
